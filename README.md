# API with SOLID

Hello Dev ✌!

Do you already know what SOLID is? 😵

## The word SOLID means:

- **S** - Single-responsiblity Principle
A class should have one and only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one job.

- **O** - Open-closed Principle
 Objects or entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
 
- **L** - Liskov Substitution Principle
Let q(x) be a property provable about objects of x of type T. Then q(y) should be provable for objects y of type S where S is a subtype of T.

- **I** - Interface Segregation Principle
A client should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesn’t use, or clients shouldn’t be forced to depend on methods they do not use.

- **D** - Dependency Inversion Principle
Entities must depend on abstractions, not on concretions. It states that the high-level module must not depend on the low-level module, but they should depend on abstractions.

##

### Objective of repo:
This projects have the main objective to practice the SOLID principles.
